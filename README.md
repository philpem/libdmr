LibDMR - DMR radio protocol stack

LibDMR is a scratch-built implementation of the ETSI DMR protocol stack. The goal is to create an unencumbered, clearly-licensed DMR stack for amateur radio applications. We aim to make it easier for hams to make use of DMR's data features.

LibDMR is built with several goals in mind:

  * Provably correct: A full unit, integration and regression test harness to prove that LibDMR is working correctly.
  * Understandable: Code should be well-written, well-commented, and refer back to the DMR standards where needed.
  * Clearly licensed: Apache Licence version 2.0 for all source files in this repository.
  * Easy to use: API is easy to use and well-defined.
